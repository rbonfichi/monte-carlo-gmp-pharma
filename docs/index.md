# 📘 Monte Carlo Methods for GMP & Pharma Operations  
_Statistical Simulation Tools for Pharmaceutical Quality and GMP Decision-Making_

---

## 📖 Introduction
This project is a practical, industry-focused **eBook** introducing **Monte Carlo methods** for professionals working in **pharmaceutical manufacturing, quality control, and GMP operations**.  

It is not a purely theoretical treatise — the emphasis is on **real-world applications** where Monte Carlo simulation can support decision-making, process understanding, and risk assessment.

The goal is to provide **practical statistical tools** that can be applied immediately in GMP decision-making contexts.
