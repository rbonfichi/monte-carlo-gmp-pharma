# üìò Monte Carlo Methods for GMP & Pharma Operations  
_Statistical Simulation Tools for Pharmaceutical Quality and GMP Decision-Making_

---

## üìñ Introduction
This project is a practical, industry-focused **eBook** introducing **Monte Carlo methods** for professionals working in **pharmaceutical manufacturing, quality control, and GMP operations**.  

It is not a purely theoretical treatise ‚Äî the emphasis is on **real-world applications** where Monte Carlo simulation can support decision-making, process understanding, and risk assessment.  

A distinctive feature of this eBook is the inclusion of **real-world case studies** (e.g., assay, dissolution, process validation, CPV).  
These case studies are progressively expanded, illustrating how Monte Carlo and related methods can be applied to typical GMP scenarios.  

The book also provides **historical and regulatory context** (e.g., ICH Q9(R1), USP <1210>, FDA/EMA guidance),  
ensuring that statistical methods are presented in a way that is both scientifically rigorous and inspection-ready.  

The goal is to provide **practical statistical tools** that can be applied immediately in GMP decision-making contexts.

## üöÄ Next Steps

This eBook is a living project and will continue to evolve over time.
Future improvements may include:
- Refine and expand chapters with clearer explanations, figures, and diagrams
- Add new pharmaceutical case studies to illustrate practical applications
- Introducing advanced statistical tools (e.g., Resampling, Bootstrap, Bayesian methods)
- Exploring integration with quality standards (ICH Q2(R2), USP <1210>, ISO 3951-1, etc.)
- Translating into additional languages for wider accessibility
- Providing ready-to-use R scripts and templates for QA/QC teams
- Collecting feedback from readers to guide future improvements
