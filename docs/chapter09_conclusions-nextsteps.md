# Chapter 9 ‚Äî Conclusions and Next Steps

## üìå Conclusions
This mini-ebook introduced the practical application of **Monte Carlo simulation** in a GMP pharmaceutical context.  
By moving step-by-step ‚Äî from defining inputs to interpreting risk metrics ‚Äî we demonstrated how simulation results can directly support **risk-based decision-making**.

Key takeaways:
- Simulation connects process knowledge with statistical rigor.
- Quantitative risk metrics (e.g., `p_out`, Cpk) enable objective decisions.
- Graphical outputs make results intuitive for technical and non-technical audiences.

## üöÄ Next Steps
Future extensions of this work may include:
- **Bootstrap methods** to estimate uncertainty of capability indices.
- **Non-normal capability analysis** using percentile-based indices.
- **Case studies** from microbiological counts, dissolution, and stability data.
- Integration with **measurement uncertainty** in risk evaluation.
- Advanced decision frameworks combining **Bayesian approaches** and Monte Carlo.

By adding these topics, the guide could evolve from a simulation primer into a **complete decision-support manual** for pharmaceutical statistics.
