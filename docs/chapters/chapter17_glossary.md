# Chapter 17 — Glossary

This glossary clarifies some key terms used throughout the eBook.  
It will expand in future releases as new chapters and case studies are added.

## 🔑 Transfer Equation
- **Technical definition (simulation theory, e.g., Hammersley & Handscomb, 1964; Ripley, 1987):**  
  A mathematical transformation that converts a random number `r ∼ U(0,1)` into a random variate following a target distribution.  
  Example: For an exponential distribution with rate λ,  
  `x = - (1/λ) * log(r)`.  

- **Modeling definition (applied Monte Carlo, e.g., Hubbard, 2014):**  
  The *system model* equation that combines input variables (themselves uncertain/random) to produce an output.  
  Example: `Annual Savings = (MS + LS + RMS) × PL`.  

- **In this eBook:**  
  We primarily use the **modeling definition** (Hubbard, 2014), since in GMP and pharma applications we care about how input uncertainties (assay weights, purities, dissolution times) propagate to outputs.  
  Nevertheless, the technical definition underpins the generation of random variates.

## 🔑 Random Number
A pseudo-random value in [0,1] generated by a computer algorithm.  
Used as the raw input for creating random variates.

- **In this eBook:**  
  Random numbers are always the *starting point* for generating random variates used in simulations.

---

## 🔑 Random Variate
A value drawn from a specific probability distribution (Normal, Uniform, Triangular, etc.), usually obtained by transforming a random number through the appropriate transfer equation.

- **In this eBook:**  
  Random variates are the **true simulated data points** (e.g., assay %, dissolution value, microbial count) that feed into the transfer equation of the system model.

---

## 🔑 p_out (Probability of OOS)
The probability that a simulated batch falls **Out of Specification (OOS)**.  
It is estimated as the proportion of simulated values lying outside the lower and/or upper specification limits (LSL, USL).

- **In this eBook:**  
  p_out is the central risk metric in all case studies (assay, dissolution, process validation).  
  It provides a direct and intuitive measure of process conformance risk.

---

## 🔑 Capability Indices (Cp, Cpk, Percentile-based)
Indices that quantify how well a process fits within its specification limits.

- **Cp**: measures process spread relative to specification width.  
- **Cpk**: also accounts for centering relative to the target/mean.  
- **Percentile-based indices**: non-parametric alternative, comparing extreme quantiles with specification limits (useful when data are non-normal or skewed).

- **In this eBook:**  
  Cp and Cpk are reported when applicable, but emphasis is given to percentile-based indices, which are more robust in pharmaceutical contexts (e.g., dissolution, microbiology).

---

## 🔑 Bootstrap
A resampling method that estimates variability and confidence intervals by repeatedly sampling **with replacement** from observed data.

- **In this eBook:**  
  Bootstrap is used to quantify the uncertainty of capability indices and tail probabilities, especially when datasets are small (e.g., 3 PPQ batches, limited stability data).

---

## 🔑 OC Curve (Operating Characteristic Curve)
A plot that shows the probability of accepting a lot as a function of its actual quality level (e.g., % defective units).  
Originates from sampling theory (e.g., ISO 2859-1, ISO 3951-1).

- **In this eBook:**  
  OC curves are discussed in relation to future case studies on **sampling and acceptance plans**, where Monte Carlo is used to empirically estimate acceptance probabilities under different process conditions.

---

## 📌 Note
This glossary will be progressively expanded as new chapters are added  
(e.g., dissolution, microbiology, stability, advanced capability measures).
