# Chapter 4 ‚Äî The Transfer Equation (Model)

Monte Carlo simulations need a way to connect **random inputs** to the **output** we want to study.  
This connection is expressed mathematically by the **transfer equation**.

---

## üîó What is the Transfer Equation?

- **Definition:** A mathematical formula (or algorithm) that transforms one or more input variables into the output of interest.
- **Purpose:** It represents how the real-world process works, including uncertainty in inputs.

**Generic Form:**
`Output = f(Input‚ÇÅ, Input‚ÇÇ, ..., Input‚Çô)`

## üì¶ Example in GMP & Pharma

Suppose we want to simulate the **assay** of an active ingredient in a tablet:

- `API_weight` ‚Üí random variable (mg)
- `Tablet_weight` ‚Üí random variable (mg)
- `Purity` ‚Üí random variable (fraction)

**Practical note ‚Äî Purity as % vs fraction**
In QC practice, **Purity** is typically reported as a **percentage** (e.g., 99.2%).
In the transfer equation, however, it is convenient to use Purity as a **fraction** (e.g., 0.992) and multiply by 100 only at the end to express **Assay (%)**.
To avoid confusion, we explicitly state that Purity is handled as a fraction inside the model.

**Transfer Equation:**
`Assay (%) = (API_weight / Tablet_weight) √ó Purity √ó 100`

## üíª Example in R

```r
set.seed(123)

n <- 10000
Label_Claim <- 100          # mg declared on the product label

# 1. Random inputs
API_weight <- rnorm(n, mean = 100, sd = 1.5)    # mg of API per tablet
Purity     <- rnorm(n, mean = 0.995, sd = 0.002) # fraction purity
Purity[Purity > 1]  <- 1       # clamp unrealistic >100%
Purity[Purity < 0.98] <- 0.98  # clamp unrealistic <98%

# 2. Transfer equation: % of label claim
Assay <- (API_weight * Purity / Label_Claim) * 100

# 3. Output analysis
hist(Assay,
     main = "Simulated Assay (% of Label Claim)",
     xlab = "Assay (%)",
     col = "lightblue", border = "white")
abline(v = c(97, 103), col = "red", lwd = 2, lty = 2)  # specification limits
```

‚ÑπÔ∏è **Note on "Label Claim" vs. "% w/w in Tablet"**  
In pharmaceutical QC, *assay* is normally expressed as a percentage of the **label claim** ‚Äî  
i.e., how much active ingredient is measured compared to the amount declared on the product label (e.g., 100 mg).  
This is why specifications are usually written as *97.0‚Äì103.0% of label claim*.  

By contrast, the ratio `(API_weight / Tablet_weight) √ó 100` gives the **% w/w in the tablet** (here ~40%).  
While correct mathematically, it does not correspond to regulatory assay specifications.  
For this reason, the transfer equation in this example uses **label claim** in the denominator.

## üíä Why It Matters in Pharma
- The transfer equation defines **the model** ‚Äî a wrong equation = wrong simulation.

- It helps identify **which input contributes most** to variability (sensitivity analysis).

- Essential in **process validation**, **robustness studies**, and **risk assessment**.
