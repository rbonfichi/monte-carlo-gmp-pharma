# Chapter 11 — Glossary

This glossary clarifies some key terms used throughout the eBook.  
It will expand in future releases as new chapters and case studies are added.

## 🔑 Transfer Equation
- **Technical definition (simulation theory):**  
  A mathematical transformation that converts a random number `r ∼ U(0,1)` into a random variate following a target distribution.  
  Example: For an exponential distribution with rate λ,  
  `x = - (1/λ) * log(r)`.  

- **Modeling definition (applied Monte Carlo, e.g., Hubbard):**  
  The *system model* equation that combines input variables (themselves uncertain/random) to produce an output.  
  Example: `Annual Savings = (MS + LS + RMS) × PL`.  

- **In this eBook:**  
  We primarily use the **modeling definition**, since in GMP and pharma applications we care about how input uncertainties (assay weights, purities, dissolution times) propagate to outputs.  
  Nevertheless, the technical definition underpins the generation of random variates.

## 🔑 Random Number
A pseudo-random value in [0,1] generated by a computer algorithm.  
Used as the raw input for creating random variates.

---

## 🔑 Random Variate
A value drawn from a specific probability distribution (Normal, Uniform, Triangular, etc.), usually obtained by transforming a random number through the appropriate transfer equation.
