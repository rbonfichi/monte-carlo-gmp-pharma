## What this is
A living, practitioner‑oriented guide to **Monte Carlo simulation** for **GMP‑compliant pharmaceutical operations** (manufacturing, QA/QC, validation), focused on **practical application** rather than heavy theory.

> *This project is a work in progress. Suggestions and comments are welcome, but all content is curated and approved by the author.*

## Target Audience
This guide is intended for:
- **QA/QC managers** in pharmaceutical and chemical‑pharmaceutical manufacturing  
- **Validation engineers** (process, cleaning, analytical method)  
- **Industrial statisticians** working in **GMP** environments  
- **Regulatory/compliance specialists** who need quantitative support for decisions

It is **not** focused on clinical biostatistics or clinical trial design.

---

## How to Use This Guide
The material is organized in progressive **blocks** (modules). Read in order for best results.

- **Code in R.** All computational examples are provided in **R**. Scripts are self‑contained and can be run in **RStudio**.
- **Numerical examples.** Each block includes realistic examples from GMP contexts (e.g., process capability, OOS probability, validation).
- **Step‑by‑step approach.** Concepts build on one another with minimal prerequisites.
- **Excel notes.** Where useful, parallel sanity checks are suggested for spreadsheet users.

> **No advanced mathematics required.** The focus is on practical application, not on abstract proofs or asymptotics.
