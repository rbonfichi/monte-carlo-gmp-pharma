## üìñ Introduction
This repository is a practical, industry-focused introduction to **Monte Carlo methods** for professionals working in **pharmaceutical manufacturing, quality control, and GMP operations**.  
It is not a purely theoretical treatise ‚Äî the emphasis is on **real-world applications** where Monte Carlo simulation can support decision-making, process understanding, and risk assessment.

## üéØ Course Structure
The course follows 8 progressive modules:

| Block | Topic | Objective |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| **1** | What is the Monte Carlo Method | Understand the core idea: repetition + randomness |
| **2** | Random Numbers vs. Random Variates | Learn the difference and why it matters |
| **3** | Basic Distributions | Uniform, Normal, Exponential, Triangular |
| **4** | Transfer Equation | Building models with uncertain inputs |
| **5** | Full Simulation in R | Step-by-step execution |
| **6** | Result Analysis | Histograms, mean, variance, confidence intervals |
| **7** | Pharmaceutical Case Study | OOS, process capability, dose delivery |
| **8** | Decision & Risk | Using Monte Carlo for decision-making |
