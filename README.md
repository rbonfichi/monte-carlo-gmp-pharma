## Introduction
This repository is a practical, industry-focused introduction to **Monte Carlo methods** for professionals working in **pharmaceutical manufacturing, quality control, and GMP operations**.  
It is not a purely theoretical treatise — the emphasis is on **real-world applications** where Monte Carlo simulation can support decision-making, process understanding, and risk assessment.

## Monte Carlo in Pharma: Why It Matters
**Monte Carlo methods can:**

- Estimate process capability with uncertainty

- Quantify risk of OOS before release

- Support GMP decisions with quantitative evidence

- Model measurement uncertainty in QC labs

- Evaluate sampling plans and acceptance criteria
