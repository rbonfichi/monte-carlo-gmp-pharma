## 📘 Introduction
This project is a practical, industry-focused mini-eBook (hosted on GitHub) introducing **Monte Carlo methods** for professionals working in **pharmaceutical manufacturing, quality control, and GMP operations**.  
It is not a purely theoretical treatise — the emphasis is on **real-world applications** where Monte Carlo simulation can support decision-making, process understanding, and risk assessment.
This resource is meant to bridge the gap between theory and real GMP challenges, making Monte Carlo methods practical, repeatable, and decision-oriented.

## 💻 Getting Started
**Requirements:**
- R (≥ 4.0)
- RStudio (recommended)
- Required R packages:
  ```r
  install.packages(c("ggplot2", "dplyr", "parallel"))
  
If you are new to R, we recommend installing RStudio Desktop and trying the examples interactively. All scripts are self-contained and commented.

## 💊 Monte Carlo in Pharma: Why It Matters
**Monte Carlo methods can:**

- Estimate process capability with uncertainty

- Estimate the probability of OOS, batch failure, or sampling variability in QC testing before release.

- Support GMP decisions with quantitative evidence

- Model measurement uncertainty in QC labs

- Evaluate sampling plans and acceptance criteria
