## 📘 Introduction
This project is a practical, industry-focused mini-eBook (hosted on GitHub) introducing **Monte Carlo methods** for professionals working in **pharmaceutical manufacturing, quality control, and GMP operations**.  
It is not a purely theoretical treatise — the emphasis is on **real-world applications** where Monte Carlo simulation can support decision-making, process understanding, and risk assessment.

## 🗂️ Course Structure
The course follows 8 progressive modules:

| Block | Topic                              | Objective                                         |
| ----- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **1** | What is the Monte Carlo Method     | Understand the core idea: repetition + randomness |
| **2** | Random Numbers vs. Random Variates | Learn the difference and why it matters           |
| **3** | Basic Distributions                | Uniform, Normal, Exponential, Triangular          |
| **4** | Transfer Equation                  | Building models with uncertain inputs             |
| **5** | Full Simulation in R               | Step-by-step execution                            |
| **6** | Result Analysis                    | Histograms, mean, variance, confidence intervals  |
| **7** | Pharmaceutical Case Study          | OOS, process capability, dose delivery            |
| **8** | Decision & Risk                    | Using Monte Carlo for decision-making             |

## 💊 Monte Carlo in Pharma: Why It Matters
**Monte Carlo methods can:**

- Estimate process capability with uncertainty

- Quantify risk of OOS before release

- Support GMP decisions with quantitative evidence

- Model measurement uncertainty in QC labs

- Evaluate sampling plans and acceptance criteria
