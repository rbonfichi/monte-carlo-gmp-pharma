## 📖 About
This repository hosts an **eBook** on **Monte Carlo methods** for professionals working in **pharmaceutical manufacturing, quality control, and GMP operations**.  
It focuses on **practical applications** for decision-making, process understanding, and risk assessment — not on abstract theory.  

A distinctive feature of this eBook is the inclusion of **real-world case studies** (e.g., assay, dissolution, process validation, CPV).  
These case studies are progressively expanded, illustrating how Monte Carlo and related methods can be applied to typical GMP scenarios.
