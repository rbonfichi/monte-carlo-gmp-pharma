# QUICKSTART — First Publication on GitHub

**Goal:** Put this project online under your GitHub account as a simple “book-like” repository and enable GitHub Pages.

## 1) Create a new repository
- Name: **monte-carlo-gmp-pharma**
- Visibility: Public (or Private if you prefer)
- Do **not** add README (we already have one).

## 2) Upload files
- Click **Add file → Upload files**.
- Drag & drop the entire folder contents (all files and the `chapters/`, `images/`, `code/` subfolders).
- Click **Commit changes**.

## 3) Enable GitHub Pages
- Go to **Settings → Pages**.
- **Build and deployment**: Source = **Deploy from a branch**.
- Branch = **main**, Folder = **/root** (or **/docs** if you move files later).
- Save. Wait ~1–2 minutes, then a public URL will be shown (copy it).

## 4) Verify
- Open the public URL and check that the repository renders OK on mobile and desktop.

That’s it — your project is online. You can refine later (e.g., migrate to Jupyter Book for a full “book” look).
